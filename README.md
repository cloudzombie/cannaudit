open source library and app that satisfies Oregon "Seed to Sale Tracking system" to be known as “The System”

I have added the RFP documents.

Background:
In 2014 the voters of Oregon elected to legalize recreational marijuana. Oregon has a Medical Marijuana program that has been around for a long time.  To satisfy federal rules, cannabis should be audited.  At this time the Oregon Medical Marijuana only has limited auditing.  The goal is to create a system that can audit both recreational and medical marijuana, but according to measure 91 the medical  marijuana program is not changed.  This creates a problem of how to audit the medical program. The powers that be want to get rid of the medical program and just collect taxes.  

I propose using cryptography and economics to encourage the medical growers to audit.  Have a anonymous token that identifies the grower.  It could be a hash of the driver license number.  The other part is a “cannabis credit” this represents a some amount of marijuana.  Only valid credit is allowed into the system.

I am asking the open source community to help define and program this project.
